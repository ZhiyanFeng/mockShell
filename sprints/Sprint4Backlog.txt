//Sprint 4 Backlog.  
July 18 to July 22

Product Backlog items to be implemented:
a) Create CRC cards for new classes.
b) List Contents Recursively
c) Push Directory and Pop Directory
d) Get File from URL
e) Remove Path	
f) Create Interpreter helper class for Jshell
g) Adjust JShell to allow all commands excluding exit to apply > OUTFILE or
 >> OUTFILE to the regular command. Only create outfiles for commands that
 would otherwise print output to the console.

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1) Update CRC card collection
b-1) Adjust DirectoryLister class to list contents recursively when specified
b-2) Make any consequent required changes in Jshell/interpreter
 to process this change
c-1) Create stack class for working directories with push and pop method for
working directories 
c-2) Make any consequent required changes in Jshell/interpreter to accept this
new class and commands
d-1) Create class to handle command to get file from URL, may need to create 
helper classes to assist with this
d-2) Make any consequent required changes in Jshell/interpreter to accept this
new class and commands
e-1) Create class to remove a path (relative or absolute) - must only remove
after receiving confirmation from the user, if the path is a directory, 
recursively remove all files and directories in it, prompting
for confirmation before remove each one. If specified, do not prompt for
 confirmation. This class may take more than one sprint to complete
e-2) Make any consequent required changes in Jshell/interpreter to accept this
new class and commands
f-1) Create Interpeter helper class for Jshell - class that interprets user
input
g-1) Adjust Jshell and interpreter to accomadate > OUTFILE or >> OUTFILE to 
every command except exit.
