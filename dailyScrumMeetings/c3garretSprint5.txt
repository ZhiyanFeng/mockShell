What did I do last time?
	- Created CRC card for class that gets file from URL
	- Created class that gets file from URL and implement it in 
	JShell/Interpreter/Redirection
	- Created CRC card for helper class, Interpreter, for JShell
	- Created Interpreter
	- Created CRC card for helper class, Redirection, for Interpreter
	- Created Redirection
	- Ajusted JShell and interpreter so they allows all commands to include 
	> OUTFILE or >> OUTFILE by creating redirection
	- Ajusted the echo  class to work with the above requirement
	- Created test class for get file from URL and adjusted echo test and
	syntax checker test


What do I plan to do now?
	- May create test class for Interpreter and redirection, although
	they mainly just call on other classes

Am I blocked on anything?
	- no
