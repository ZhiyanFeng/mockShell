What did I do last time?
	- Nothing! This is the first sprint

What do I plan to do now?
	- Argue about and finalize CRC cards with group members
	- Start coding Tree-style data structure using FileSystem, Directory
		 and (to a lesser extent) File

Am I blocked on anything?
	- A little confused on using FileSystem as the root of the tree
