What did I do last time?
	- Helped my group finish off CRC cards
	- Created outline of code for JShell

What do I plan to do now?
	- Write a string documentation variable for each command class
	- Create a class to print documentation for any class
	- Write a class to make a new file with a string or append to an existing file
	  (related to echo command)

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Must look up how to make and edit files in Java code
