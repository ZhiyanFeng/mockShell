What did I do last time?
	- Wrote a string documentation variable for each command subclass
	- Created working working echo class

What do I plan to do now?
	- Make echo code more efficient
	- Write JUnit tests for echo
	- Change all string documentations to private

Am I blocked on anything?
	- making echo code more efficient
