What did I do last time?
	- Made changes to data structure (reverted after discussion with group), 
	- Added more methods into Directory
	- Implemented DirectoryMaker command class with static method MakeDir
	- Added separate getDir method in DirectoryGetter

What do I plan to do now?
	- Implement what commands we have in JShell to prepare for demonstration

Am I blocked on anything?
