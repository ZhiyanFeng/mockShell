What did I do last time?
	- Updated some CRC cards
	- Started working on the echo class

What do I plan to do now?
	- Start coding the FileCopier and FileMover classes

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Waiting for the working directory and root directory to be coded 
	(i.e stored in jShell or a fileSystem class) before I can continue 
	working.
