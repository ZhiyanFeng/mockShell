What did I do last time?
	- first sprint of a2b, so nothing


What do I plan to do now?
	- Create CRC card for class that gets file from URL
	- Create class that gets file from URL and implement it in 
	JShell/Interpreter
	- Create CRC card for helper class, Interpreter, for JShell
	- Create Interpreter
	- Ajust JShell and interpreter so they allows all commands to include 
	> OUTFILE or >> OUTFILE
	- Ajust the echo  class to work with the above requirement
Am I blocked on anything?
	- How to get file content from a URL, I will look it up
