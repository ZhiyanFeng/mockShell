What did I do last time?
	- Complete coding FileCopier and FileMover classes
	- Corrected some bugs with the Directory class

What do I plan to do now?
	- Write Javadocs and unit tests for FileCopier and FileMover
	- Resolve any remaining issues for any code that I've written.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Still trying to find a way to move some of the code for FileCopier's
	  copy method into helper classes
